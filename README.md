### Overview

Graph Quilt Gateway exposes data from various graph microservices using a single unified GraphQL schema. These microservices can be dynamically
registered with the Gateway using the `/register` endpoint. It uses [graphql orchestrator library](https://github.com/graph-quilt/graphql-orchestrator-java) for federating schemas from 
various data providers. 

Top Highlights include

* Dynamic registration so that the gateway is loosely coupled with the provider development lifecycle.
* Registering REST endpoints using the [@adapter](https://github.com/graph-quilt/graphql-service-adapters) directive and Service DSL
* Attribute Based Access Control using the [graphql-authorization-java](https://github.com/graph-quilt/graphql-authorization-java) library.

### Pre-requisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine

* jdk 1.8
* maven
* docker
* awscli 

### Running the graph-quilt gateway locally

When running the application locally, [localstack](https://localstack.cloud/) is used to mock AWS S3.  Follow this steps to start the application.

* Build the project
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```

* Run aws configure.  Enter any value to the prompts presented.  Since localstack is used, a real AWS credential is not needed.
    ```
    aws configure
    ```

* Start Docker daemon if not running.
    
* Start the local registry.  This starts a localstack docker container.
    ```
    ./local_registry/start.sh
    ```
  
* Set up the local registry.  This will initialize the registry with example service providers in `local_registry` folder.
    ```
    ./local_registry/setup.sh --empty-registry
    ```
    
* Start the application.  Once started, it listens on port 7000

    ```
    ./run.sh
    ```
    OR 
   
    Run the class `GraphqlGatewayApplication` as Spring Application using IntelliJ. Set the active profile as **local**.
    
**No need to restart the application when new you register a new provider service**.


### Run with docker compose

The docker compose will start both **localstack** and **graphql gateway**.  To start, run the command

`$ docker compose -f docker-compose-local-registry.yml up`

You should see the Spring Boot Logo and a message "Started GraphQLGatewayApplication ..."
  
### Test using GraphiQL

* Navigate to [http://localhost:7000/graphiql](http://localhost:7000/graphiql)
